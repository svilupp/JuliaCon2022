Always ask the experts if it's realistic for your business/type of campaign/position in the funnel!\nFor beta_spend coefficients use either a conservative range (eg, centered around 1 and from 0 to 5) or leverage data from previous experiments / from experts\nHow to set priors for all else\nTalk to the subject matter experts in your business on what a realistic range of values would be (on the overall modelled quantity / for the implied dynamic). If it's hard to judge, ask them for what values would be impossible, which gives you edges for your prior distributions. If possible, ask them to also give you a sense how quite the likelihood of different values goes up or down within the range (good exercise is to ask them to stack PET bottle caps or post-it note packs to representive the relative likelihood of different values)\nOnce you know some boundary values and the relative shape, play with plot() and various distributions to achieve the desired fit, eg, plot(Beta(10,10)) and visually inspect if it matches the provided knowledge\nHow to fit\nDiscussion on 1 vs 2 stages...(TBU)\nExcellent paper on Bayesian workflow\nHow to extend / more advanced implementations\nComplicated trends: splines (example provided for Splines2 package)\nBig data - Variation Inference in Turing (ELBO!), ZigZag, or simply a MAP\nWhat are some good diagnostics\nBayesian workflow\nRhat metric should never be above 1.1, ideally close to 1.0 for the parameters that we care about\n(HMC/NUTS specific) No divergences. Divergences indicate that the algorithm was not able to fully explore the posterior distribution. There is a folk theorem that it's usually due to a bad model - investigate pair plots, variables with low rhat or with low n_eff and try to re-paramterize where possible.
